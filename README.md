Write the method ```plantCross()``` in Jeroo.java that will plant flowers around the cross as shown in the pictures below.

IMPORTANT:  You can only use:
* ```hop()```
* ```plant()```
* ```turn(LEFT)```
* ```turn(RIGHT)```

You should be using helper methods.  Do NOT put all the code inside of plantCross()
